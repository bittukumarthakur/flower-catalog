        African Violets are one of the most popular plants for indoor gardens. Most species naturally live in the
        mountains, usually under the cover of other plants. Because of this, they require moderate temperatures and
        light, which can easily be found and controlled inside of homes. However, some indoor gardeners shy away from
        growing them because their care can be intimidating. These plants come in almost every color and have a frilly
        or fringed texture to the petals. They will bloom nearly every day if in bright and dependable lighting. The
        foliage is typically green or variegated, with a slight fuzz in texture.
