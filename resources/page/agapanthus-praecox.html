      <p>Agapanthus praecox (common agapanthus, blue lily, African lily, or lily of the Nile) is a popular garden plant
        around the world, especially in Mediterranean climates. It is native to the Kwa-Zulu Natal and Western Cape
        provinces of South Africa. Local names include agapant, bloulelie, isicakathi and ubani.[1] Most of the
        cultivated plants of the genus Agapanthus are hybrids or cultivars of this species. It is divided into three
        subspecies: subsp.praecox, subsp. orientalis and subsp. minimus.
        Agapanthus praecox is a variable species with open-faced flowers. It is a perennial plant that can live for up
        to 75 years. Its evergreen leaves are 2 cm wide and 50 cm long. Its inflorescence is an umbel. The flowers are
        blue, purple or white and bloom from late spring to summer, followed by capsules filled with black seeds. Its
        flowering stem reaches one meter high. Its roots are very powerful and can break concrete.
