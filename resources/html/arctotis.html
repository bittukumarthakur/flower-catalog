      <p>Arctotis is a genus of annual and perennial plants in the family Asteraceae.

        Arctotis is native to dry stony slopes in southern Africa. Some of the plants are alternatively placed in the
        genus Venidium. The common name is "African daisy", or "Gousblom" in Afrikaans. These plants have daisy-like
        composite flowers which tend to close in the late afternoon or in dull weather, but numerous cultivars have been
        developed for garden use which stay open for longer, and are available in a wide range of colours. Tender
        perennials are often grown in temperate regions as half-hardy annuals.

        The garden hybrid A. hybrida hort. 'Flame' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

        Vigorous Arctotis hybrids like 'Pink Sugar' and 'Large Marge' are popular choices for garden design for the
        diverse colors of their blooms.
